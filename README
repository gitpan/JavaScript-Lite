JavaScript::Lite
================

JavaScript::Lite is a bare-bones interface to the SpiderMonkey
ECMAscript engine. It aims to provide as little functionality (and
therefore as little overhead) as is neccessary to connect perl with
ECMAscript. Efficiency is the goal here; the intended environments
are places where you are going to be calling from perl into
ECMAscript thousands (or millions) of times in succession.

Please note that this is an alpha release. I intend to keep the
API more-or-less stable, but there may be quirks, and new features
will be added in future releases (so long as they do not slow the
existing features down!).

INSTALLATION
============

JavaScript::Lite doesn't try very hard to compile properly.
It looks for your SpiderMonkey API as either "libjs" or
"libmozjs", and adds "/usr/include/mozjs" to your C compiler's
include path. If you have both "libjs" and "libmozjs" on your
system, it will try to link against both of them, which is
probably not what you want.

Ohhh yeah... alpha software. Gotta love it.

As people write in to complain (or hopefully with patches), we'll
get all the edge cases sorted out and things should compile everywhere.
Maybe if I'm lucky some CPAN testers will have SpiderMonkey installed
on their build systems.

Under debian or ubuntu, you can get the neccessary libraries and
headers installed with the following command (run as root):

  aptitude install libmozjs-dev

For redhat/centos, I had to scour the net for the appropriate
RPMs. Search for "mozjs" or "spidermonkey", depending on which
of the dozens of redhat flavours you are running.
